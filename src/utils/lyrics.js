You're a funny kind of meds,
I'm sick.

Your friends condescend to me,
Got me thinking on an end,
To me, 
Time's ticked.

Since when do I depend on you?

I was a stone unturned,
Wasn't I?
Pleasantly petrified,
Now you got me rolling down.

What do you suppose I do,
Tonight?
I swear I won't put up a fight,
Now you got me on the ground.

Since when do I depend on you?

From when you stepped into my house,
To when you sat down on my couch,
You checked out. 
From when I stepped into your house,
To when I sat down on your couch,
You checked out. 

Since when do I depend on you?`;

You're a liar, I believe
You don't want to be here, then leave

You think too much of yourself!
You think too much of yourself!
And when you cry, they apologize, isn't that nice?
You're biding time,
You're spilling mine,
Do you mind? 

You're a loner, or is it just me?
You don't phone, and they won't,
Make a scene

You love so much of yourself, 'shamed of everything else
You're so in love with yourself, 'shamed of everything else
When you cry, they apologize, isn't that nice
You're biding time,
While your killing mine,
Do you mind? `;
